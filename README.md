# DT228-2-OOP-Christmas-Game-Project
Christmas assignment for 2nd year of Computer Science.

My game is a very basic tower defence game.
The game begins on loading and enemies will spawn at the start of the path
every 1 and a half seconds, or 90 frames. The enemies will be either a jeep
which has only 10 health, or a tank which has 20. The jeeps have a 70% chance of spawning
while the tanks have only a 30% chance since they have more health.
A turret can be placed in any cell which is highlighted in yellow when hovered over with the mouse.
Turrets cost 50 money to place and you start with 50, so you have to kill some enemies to place more.
Jeeps give you 10 money on death and tanks give 20.
Turrets cannot be placed on the path, on other turrets,
or on the cell where the score and lives are displayed.
Turrets display a red ring around them illustrating the range of the tower.
